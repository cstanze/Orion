# Orion

If you're seeing this, I'm dead... kidding kidding. This project, however, has reached it's **EOL** (End of Life). I take no joy in saying those words. They in fact hurt like hell.

Attached to this repository is a post-mortem for a "future me" who would be interested in redoing this project (and to serve as the beginning of a new self-standard).

For those interested in reading about the build-up to the eventual downfall of `Orion`, please continue though be warned that I tend to get a bit *unprofessional* in my feelings about certain topics. Otherwise, this code is licensed under the MIT license so feel free to do as you please under those terms.
